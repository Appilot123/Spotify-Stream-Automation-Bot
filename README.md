<h1 align="center">Spotify Stream Automation Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:
This project automates Spotify streaming actions using stealth techniques, targeting both consultation and hands-on automation with Python. It addresses challenges like consistent playback failures on Spotify Web, bot-detection evasion, and stream legitimacy for royalty generation. The bot is designed for scalability and focuses on mimicking human behavior to bypass Spotify’s anti-bot systems, with an emphasis on mobile/desktop stream optimization over Web-based access.


## Core Features:
- **Stealth Playback Engine:** Handles stream playback issues like "Spotify can't play this right now" with fallback logic.
- **Royalty-Compliant Streaming Logic:** Focused on IP and timeout strategies that align with Spotify’s detection patterns to maximize legitimate play counts.
- **Cross-Platform Readiness:** Built to integrate with desktop automation tools (like Appium or Puppeteer) to move beyond web limitations.
